# Hi there, I'm S0mbrero! 👋

I'm a <!--YEAR_DIFF-->17<!--YEAR_DIFF-->-year-old student, passionate about technology and programming. Ever since I was a kid, watching my dad work on the computer, I knew that technology was my world. Over 12 years later, here I am, pursuing my dream of becoming a programmer and working directly with machines. While I'm still in school, in my third year of a vocational high school with an IT focus, I am driven to make this passion a reality.

## About Me

- **Age**: <!--YEAR_DIFF-->17<!--YEAR_DIFF-->
- **School**: Vocational IT High School
- **Main Interests**: Programming, IT, Systems and Networks, and tech in general.
- **From the start of this journey**: 💻 <!--CODING_YEARS-->6<!--CODING_YEARS--> years.
- **Languages/Technologies**: 
  - **C++** (My favorite! 💻)
  - **Assembly** (I love understanding how machines work at a low level 🔧)
  - **Python** 🐍
  - **HTML/CSS** (I know they're not programming languages, but I still like working with them 🌐)

Although I face challenges, especially with motivation and time management (due to my school workload), I'm committed to finding ways to grow as a programmer. I dream of going solo and working on my own projects, but it's hard to balance everything. My grades are generally around 8 or 9 out of 10, which I'm proud of, but I want to dedicate more time to personal projects and practice.
